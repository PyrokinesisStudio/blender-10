# blender plugins and fun

So far I'm experimenting with braids in blender.

## Braid Plugin

[See install information here](docs/install.md)

## Using the script
This is for the hackers among you that want to mess with the code. **Note:** this script is an older version (than the above plugin), and the braids it makes aren't as good. But it should be useful for learning some things about scripting in blender.

How To:

- Download `braidingawesome.py`  
- (Install and) open [blender 2.6](http://www.blender.org/)  
- Open [the text editor](http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Extensions/Python/Text_editor) in blender
- press `alt o` or click the menu `Text > Open text block`  
- select the `braidingawesome.py` file you just download  
- hit `Run Script` (or `alt p`)

There are a number of examples ready there, so you can just change `example6()` to `example5()`, etc. at the very bottom to see what is there.

Play around with the parameters, and see what happens! If you have questions or suggestions, feel free to get in touch via the [github issues](https://github.com/jaredly/blender/issues).
